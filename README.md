# CONTIKI - FIRST STEPS

This is a student project about programming a lightweight operating system on a remote computer.
It was made within a linux VM and led as an assignment for the De Vinci Innovation Center.
### Presentation

- The point of this exercise is to demonstrate the set up of a custom application from a github repository to a compiled executable.
- The content of this exercise consists of a `src` folder containing the dummy code, a `patch.diff` file meant to showcase the patching mechanic of a bugfix, and of an `install.sh` file.
- /!\ Deploying this repository requires to already have a clean `contiki.zip` file in order for the installation to work properly.
- The final executable shows a hello world and opens a contiki console for commandlines.

### Installation

Start by cloning the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Faber-smythe/contiki-sandbox
```
Put your `contiki.zip` archive inside the cloned folder.
And run the installation file :
```
bash install.sh
```

> This assignment was a teamwork of Johann IMBERT and CÃ©drine SOCQUET
